## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices

## Remember Do Not Push code directly into main branch

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Add details in subsequent lines if needed

### Branch Management

- Always branch from `main`
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Delete branches after merging PRs

### Code Quality

- Run `pnpm run prettier` before every commit
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add comments for complex logic

## ðŸ†˜ Common Issues

**Branch already exists?**

```bash
git checkout existing-branch-name
git pull origin main  # Get latest changes
```

**Forgot to format code?**

```bash
pnpm run prettier
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit  # Amend last commit
```

**Need to update your branch with latest main?**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge main
```

**Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰**
